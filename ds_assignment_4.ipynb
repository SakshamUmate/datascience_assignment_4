    "The four pillars of object-oriented programming (OOP) are:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Encapsulation:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit known as a class.\r\n",
    "It hides the internal details of the object and restricts access to some of its components, providing a protective barrier and preventing the accidental modification of data.\r\n",
    "Abstraction:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Abstraction involves simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on the essential properties and behaviors they possess.\r\n",
    "It allows developers to focus on the relevant features of an object while ignoring unnecessary details.\r\n",
    "Abstraction provides a way to create abstract classes and interfaces, defining a common interface for a group of related classes.\r\n",
    "Inheritance:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a new class (subclass or derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors from an existing class (superclass or base class).\r\n",
    "It promotes code reuse and establishes a relationship between classes, facilitating the creation of a hierarchy of classes.\r\n",
    "Polymorphism:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Polymorphism means \"many forms\" and allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class.\r\n",
    "It enables a single interface to represent entities of different types, and it can take various forms such as compile-time polymorphism (method overloading) and runtime polymorphism (method overriding).\r\n",
    "These four pillars together provide a framework for organizing and designing code in a way that promotes modularity, reusability, and maintainability in object-oriented programming."
